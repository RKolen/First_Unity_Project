# Hat trick
This is a game I have made during the CodeGorilla Bootcamp. It is made using the Unity game engine over the course of a couple of days. The objective is to catch as many bowling balls in the allowed time. The hat can move left and right with the mouse.

What I have done for this project:
- Followed the Unity tutorial hat trick to get familiar with Unity and C#
- Written the game logic (in C#).
